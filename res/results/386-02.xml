LABORATORY STUDIES:  An MRI from September 18 showed a left

kidney mass, cystic.  Hemoglobin A1c from August was 6.5 and the

LDL was 125.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes:  Her diabetes has been extremely well controlled. 

We will continue her current regimen.  We will check glucose,

hemoglobin A1c, U/A, urine, microalbuminuria.  She recently went

to the ophthalmologist.

2.  Elevated cholesterol.  Our goal is an LDL of 100.  We will

start Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.  She will return in six weeks for

follow up of this.

3.  Hypertension.  Her blood pressure is acceptable.  We will

continue her current regimen.  Results were given as needed.

4.  Allergy symptoms.  I gave her Rhinocort AQ nasal spray. 

Explained how to use it.

5.  Nodular hyperpigmented lesion on her forefeet.  I will refer

her to Dermatology for evaluation of this lesion, but the patient

says that it has been there for as long as she can remember but

it is quite atypical to my exam.

6.  Left renal cystic mass.  She has been scheduled for a

follow-up MRI for December 13.

7.  Asthma:  She is doing stably in this regard and I believe

that nasal spray will help substantially with her symptoms.
