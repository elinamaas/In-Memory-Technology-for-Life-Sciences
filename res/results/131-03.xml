Chief Complaint	

Admission note- Internal Medicine

Kenneth Weeks- 1205466





History of Present Illness	

Mr. Weeks is a 78 yr. old male who was admitted for further cardiac testing.



His PMH includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.  He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea with exertion over the past 5 weeks.  He has especially noted this when he climbs stairs or walking up an incline.  He also notes this SOB when he is walking the golf course. He denies any chest pain or orthopnea, although he states that he has been experiencing some "indigestion" the past few days.  It usually occurs in the morning. He was given sublingual nitroglycerin and notes improvement in his symptoms  His Lasix dose was increased on 4/3/96 (from 80 mg to 120 mg).  This increase did help his symptoms a little, but he still felt his exercise capacity had decreased.  



An ECHO was done on 4/10 which was not significantly changed from 1/95.  His EF was 74%, mild MR, dilated LA, symmetric LV hypertrophy without any obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities and RVSP 43 mmHg.  



A Sestamibi stress test was done on 5/19.  The patient exercised for 3 minutes 21 seconds reaching 84% of predicted HR.  His EKG had STD AVF, V4-V6.  The perfusion scans showed a moderate, reversible mid-distal anterior, septal and apical defect indicative of moderate ischemia.  LV function preserved.



He was admitted electively today for further evaluation. He arrives to Internal Medicine chest pain free and hemodynamically stable.

Plan:



1. Cardiac:  Currently pain free and hemodynamically stable

         -- Admit to Internal Medicine/telemetry

         -- NPO after MN for cardiac cath in the am

         -- Will begin ECASA

         -- Continue Atenolol- pt. recently changed from Cardiazem to Atenolol given ETT results.  HR well controlled at present.

         -- Continue Norvasc and Avapro- SBP currently well controlled. 

         -- Pt euvolemic on exam- will continue Lasix - holding tomorrow pre-cath. Follow strict I/O's and daily weights- will adjust Lasix dose as needed depending on fluid status and renal function. 

         -- Pt in AF- last Coumadin dose on Friday- will begin Heparin pre cath.  Will need to resume coumadin once all interventions completed.



2. Renal: Pre cath creatinine 2.1.  Pt had renal angiogram in 4/95 which showed patent renal arteries.

         -- Will give Mucomyst and NaHCO3 protocol pre cath.    

         -- Monitor urine output.  

         -- Follow renal function closely post dye load

         -- Will hold ARB and diuretic pre- cath- will reassess post cath.

Will continue NPH and Glipizide- holding in am of cath.  Will check fingersticks QID and cover with RISS.  Diabetic diet. Pt. also reports poor dietary compliance- will obtain nutrition consult.



4. Thrombocytopenia: Pt with long history of low platelets- per pt. he has never had this worked up.  Will follow closely. ? need for hematology consult at some point- will discuss with Dr. Felder.  Watch CBC closely while on Heparin.
