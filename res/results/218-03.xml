Reason for visit

	

  88 year old man h/o type 2 DM, CAD here for follow up



History of present illness

	

  He missed his last appointment, but today he states that he has been feeling fine. He reports no chest pain, no dyspnea, no palpitations, no orthopnea, no PND. He is ambulating around the house without a problem. He has some occasional leg pains, but he now takes acetaminophen instead of nitroglycerin. He reports no recent ankle swelling, because he states that he elevates his legs. 



He cares for his wife- doing chores around the house, such as washing dishes or making the bed. The only thing he reports being unable to do is lifting arms over his head (old problem).

Assessment and plan

	

  1. AF: recurrence of his AF, but no significant CHF and no symptoms to suggest active ischemia. He is already rate controlled on beta blocker. Decision to anti-coagulate is not easy. On one hand, he is a very functional man. On the other hand, he is 88, walks with a cane for balance, and is not very fond of frequent doctors visits. Discussed EKG findings and anticoagulation with Dr. Youmans, his cardiologist. Dr. Youmans will see patient next week. 

2. CAD/CHF: Stable- Continue ASA/BB/ACEI/statin. BP OK. 

3. DM: HbA1C normal on low dose glyburide. (+) microalb- on ACEI- check again today. 

4. PUD: no recent bleeding. No symptoms. 

5. HCM: Flushot 11/95. Declines c-scope (last 2087).
