ASA/plavix, heparin, integrilin. Lipitor.
CE until peak
A1c/lipids, BB if room. 
Staged PCI vs. CABG

Has not tolerated ACEI before. Can consider ARB if BP room. If difficulty w/ hyperkalemia could consider small standing doses of kayexolate.
Currently appears euvolimic
Rhythm: Sinus w/ old LAHB, new 1st degree AVB and new RBBB.  Given right-sided lesion at risk for complete HB.  

Observe for now. Hold BB
