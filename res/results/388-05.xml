Follow up after long absence. Pt was seen last week by Dr.Anderson and prior to that she was at Chesterfield ED and prior to that her son reports that she had been in Ghanna. I suspect she has been under someone else's care since I never prescribed Glyburide, Actos and Insulin. The last  time I saw her in January I discontinued  Metformin because of GI intolerance and her regimen was Insulin only. She did not keep subsequent appointments.


She was seen at Chesterfield ED because of pyelonephritis/UTI treated with ceftriaxone and discharged on Nitrofurantoin. She has now completed the treatment. She feels better although there is still mild dysuria, denies chills and fever. course
