EDVISIT^43294739^FINNEY, INDIANA^12/15/90^MARTIN, CONSTANCE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female

with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and

atrial fibrillation who comes in to the ER complaining of

sensation of a racing heart since 5:10 p.m. in the evening.  She

said it was acute onset and felt like palpitations.  She also

said it felt like a burning.  She had mild shortness of breath

and left arm achiness.  She had no nausea, no vomiting, no fevers

or chills.  She had no trauma, no lightheadedness, and no

syncope.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes,

and atrial fibrillation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not related.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or occasional alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Palpitations, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, the patient missed two doses today,

aspirin, simvastatin, glyburide and NovoLog.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin and IV dye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 155,

respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 136/52, O2 100% on 2 liters. 

The patient is awake and alert, well developed, well nourished,

talking in complete sentences, in no acute distress.  ENT: 

Atraumatic, normal to inspection.  Eyes are normal.  Neck: 

Normal to inspection, supple, and nontender.  Respiratory:  Clear

to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and

rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry.  Back is nontender. 

Musculoskeletal:  No lower extremity swelling or edema. 

Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.  Mood and affect is normal. 

Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact.  No motor or

sensory deficits.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Initial EKG showed a rate of about

150, unclear.  It seemed that there was T waves in V3.  There is

no evidence of ST elevation MI.  We thought this could be an SVT.

 It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation.  Our

plan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement. 

Prior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal

sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was

clear that there was T waves.  At this point, we decided to give

her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium

3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,

glucose 268.  ALT 19, AST 18, CK 350, alkaline phosphatase 128,

total bilirubin 0.5, CK-MB 5.2, troponin I less than 0.04,

calcium 9.1, and mag 1.9.  White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit

42.7, and platelets 438, 000.  INR is 1.  UA is negative for

infection with trace blood present.

PLAN:  Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient

had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.  If both of

those enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home

from the ED Observation Unit.  It is unclear the etiology of her

arrhythmia.  It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke

spontaneously.  The patient is to follow up with her primary

doctor.

DISPOSITION:  ED Observation Unit.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation, the patient's chart,

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.
