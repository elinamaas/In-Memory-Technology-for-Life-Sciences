The patient, Foust, was seen in the Emergency Department on

01/31/2095.  The patient was seen by Dr. Ferrer.  I have

discussed the management with him.  I have also seen the patient

personally and reviewed the ED record.  This is an addendum to

the record.

this morning she went to the bathroom, was sitting on the
