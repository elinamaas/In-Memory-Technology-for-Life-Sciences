Past medical history

			

  1. Paraplegia- On 10/06 the patient had a lumbar laminectomy for sciatica. His sciatical pain improved until 5/07 when he developed proximal leg weakness. By 7/07 the patient was bound to a wheelchair. Orginally an extensive workup suggested that the patient had an extramedullary tumor from T8-T12. However all biopsies were inconclusive. The patient subsequently received a T10 laminectomy on 9/09 that revealed Spinal Vascular Malformation but no tumor. The patient received serial MRI's until 12/14 that were able to demonstrate no "recurrent" tumors.

4. Recurrent UTI's

Assessment and plan

			

  The patient is a 74 year old male, with a past medical history of paraplegia (due to spinal ischemia), DMII, HTN, and recurrent UTI's, who came in for a follow up visit. 



			

1. Diabetes 

-spoke with the patient about his diabetes control. He understands that his hemoglobin A1C is 8.4. However, he doesnt want to start insulin (inconvenient) and actos (the expense). Our plan is to check another hemoglobin A1C since his diet has improved. Will consider starting low dose glypizide if hem A1C still grossly elevated

-current regiment is metformin 1000mg bid -HemA1C 2/22 was 8.5 

-patient sees an opthamologist yearly 

-patient saw a podiatrist in 1/22 

-patient on lipitor 20 -> 9/21 lipid panel Cholesterol 147, LDL 67, HDL 42 

-patient is taking ASA 

-patient is on a MVI 



			

2. HTN 

-spoke with the patient about the fact that his SBP is 130-135. He said that he would like to hold off on advancing treatment for now

-for now will continue Zestril 20mg qd and atenolol 25mg po qd

-current regiment is atenolol 25qd and Zestril 10mg qd   



			

3. Sacral decibutus ulcer 

-patient says that the wound has healed  



4. Paraplegia 

-on neurontin for neuropathic pain control 

-WILL CONSIDER increase the dosage



			

5.Recurent UTI 

-Will not give prophylaxis for recurrent UTI's. Also, will not treat patient unless he has systemic symptoms of fevers or there is a great increase in the amount of burning he has on urination 



			

6. Elevated PSA 

-urology felt that in light of stability of PSA and patient's desire not be biopsied that no intervention should occur at this time. 

-urology wants to see the patient annually. Spoke with the patient again about this today. He doesnt want to see urology again and doesnt want a rectal exam.



			

7. Anxiety 

-well controlled, will continue the Zanax 



			

8. Health Maintenance 

-patient has received pneumovac 

-last colonoscopy was on 12/18 

-gave the patient a flu vaccine (9/22) (Lot BDIKB454QH and expiration 7/3/23)



			

Return to clinic in 2 months (spoke to patient about him coming more frequently but he says that it is very difficult to come in so he'll do the best he can)



Addendum

			



			

I was present during key portions of the evaluation of the patient and agree with John Ross's findings and plan as written.  Pt. is thin, has gotten maximum benefit from metformin so options include sulfonyurea or insulin.
