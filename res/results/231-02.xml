Bruce protocol was postive at 9 minutes, 64% PMHR. Complaints of dyspnea. EKG with borderline changes. Nuclear images with moderate sized defect of anteroapical zone with partial reperfusion. Some scar. Mild LV dysfunction with EF 45-50% and apical dyskinesis.



8/2094 Admitted to CVH for elective cath. Cath with Dr Vitale found nl LM. 99% subtotal LAD with TIMI I flow. Circ was patent. RCA with proximal 30% lesions and mid 80% lesion. Nl LV gram. Treated with PTCA and stent to mid LAD with mini-vision non-drug-eluding stent (2.5 X 18 mm). Excellent results. Distal LAD with residual diffuse 30-40% lesion. Plan to return for staged intervention to RCA.



9/29/2094 she was readmitted for elective RCA PCI. A relook at her LAD stent found >90% restenosis to proximal edge of LAD stent. Treated with 2.75 X 12 mm TAXUS stent. Tolerated procedure well. Discharged the following day with creat 3.3. Plan was to again return for RCA PCI.



10/94 Cath: patent LAD stents. Mid RCA lesion treated with 2.5 X 13 mm cypher stent. Discharge delayed for neurologic changes (LOC and unresponsive) but EEG, CNIS, CT, all without new infarct (old PCA CVA). 



12/25 Developed SOB and arrived in EW at SMM with chest pain. EKG without changes. Trop +/- but continued to have chest pain. Given previous stents, she was transferred urgently to CVH for cath.

Assessment and plan:

   40 y.o. with multiple risk factors for CAD. HTN, high chol, IDDM. Previous LAD stent with restenosis. Then second LAD stent and finally RCA stent. Now with admit for NSTEMI. Transferred for urgent cath. Plan for eventual renal transplant at CVH (had been waiting for Plavix to be completed). Pre-treated with mucomyst. 



Given her previous restenosis, and the fact that further Plavix courses are postponing her renal transplant....she would be best served with CABG if she has restenosis. 



Further plan per Dr Rollins

Follow up with Dr Eaves
