Chief Complaint	

Mrs Chapman  is here today to follow up on HTN, DM 



History of Present Illness	

I saw her 2/24/87 for HTN and DM. BP was high and increased Lisinopril to 20 mg QD

Restarted Lipitpr but she still is not taking it. The pharmacy didn't give it to her. Her LDL is 116 ono 2/87 and has DM, goal <100.

Feels well. 

Had an ETT MIBI few weeks ago and no evidence of ischemia.

Denies CP, SOB, palpitations

Started walking daily around Woodstown about 3.5 miles and has lost 7 pounds since I saw her. Also eating more vegetables and fruits and less carbohydrates.



Third, she had a renal U/S done for hematuria and showed small left renal mass. Had a CT scan later that showed the same and recommended an MRI. She had it done few 9/86. Recommended to repeat it soon. Left lower pole renal lesion with MRI signal characteristics consistent with a cystic, septated, unenhancing renal lesion or bosniak grade 2. However, when compared to prior CT examination demonstrating late filling of this lesion, follow up is warranted to exclude a cystic renal neoplasm making this an overall bosniak grade 2F.
