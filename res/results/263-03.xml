EDVISIT^35093053^Dodd, Steven^08/08/80^DURHAM, DENA CHRISTENA

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

I confirm that I have seen and evaluated this patient, reviewed

the resident's documentation, discussed the evaluation, plan of

care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old gentleman with

a history of coronary artery disease who is transferred here from

an outlying institution after an episode of left chest radiated

to his arm that awoke him from sleep at about 11 o'clock.  This

resolved after some sublingual nitroglycerin at the hospital but

was associated with some diaphoresis.  He cannot tell if it is

like his previous coronary pain or not.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

abdominal pain, fever, or chills.  Otherwise, negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL, AND FAMILY

HISTORY:  As per the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Shows a well-developed morbidly obese

gentleman snoring in the bed in no acute distress.  He is

asymptomatic when I see him and complaining of being tired. 

HEENT is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx is unremarkable. 

Neck is supple.  Chest is clear.  Abdomen is morbidly obese,

soft, and nontender.  Extremities are without cyanosis, clubbing,

or edema.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient has an EKG, an abnormal

but unchanged in comparison with previously.  He had a total

troponin here of 0.99 equal to the 0.1 at the outlying

institution.  His MB is 8 with a CK of 242.  His creatinine is

also 4.5.

PLAN:  Admission to the hospital for further evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS:  Non-Q-wave, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is admitted for further care.
