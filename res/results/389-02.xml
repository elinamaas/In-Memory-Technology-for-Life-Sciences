EKG tachycardia, at least two atrial foci. RBBB.
CXR L lower lung opacity. Poor film.

Impression/Plan: 
87yoM h/o COPD, vascular disease p/w SOB, cough.  Likely COPD flare.  High WBC may be steroids, but CXR too poor to rule out PNA.  Otherwise, no clear precipitant.  Failed steroids as outpatient (dosing unclear).  Given level of dyspnea, will treat w/ solumedrol for now, and transition to prednisone when improvement/trajectory is clear.  Patient may need a longer taper than over 10d.

SOB: COPD flare +/- PNA.
	-repeat CXR in AM.
-solumedrol 125mg q6 for now.  Transition to prednisone 1mg/kg when clinically stable.  Follow trend, decide on length of taper at later date.
-advair, spiriva.  Standing albuterol nebs q4 for now.  Space nebs when improvement demonstrated.
-keep O2 sats 88-92%
CHEST PRESSURE: follow for now.  Would deserve stress.  Unless  has more activity/symptoms while here, would defer to be done as outpatient.  Does have significant risk factors.
	-ROMI by markers.
	-telemetry.
	-ASA, ARB, statin.
	-start low dose beta-blocker to see if he tolerates.
HTN: likely exacerbated by steroids.  Will be moving target in setting of changing steroid dose.
	-c/w home ARB.
	-start lopressor 25 tid for now.
	-hydralazine 25mg q6h for immediate decrease in BP now.  Taper off when able.
DM2: no meds from home
	-RISS, FS qid.
	-check A1c.
FEN: no added salt, low cholesterol/fat, no conc sweets
PROPHY: fragmin, zantac.
CODE: full code (confirmed w/ patient)
DISPO: PT eval.
