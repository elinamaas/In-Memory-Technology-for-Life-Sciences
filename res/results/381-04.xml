Infectious Disease Consult Note 


Pt: Rose Mack
MR#: 06129040

Consult Date: 3/19/94



CC/RFC: 
Pt is a 52 year old w/ chronic R heel wound, now w/ wound infection. Consultation was requested by Dr. Katz for recommendations regarding antibiotic management.



HPI:  Pt has longstanding DM and PVD complicated by severe R foot ulceration. She underwent R femoral to posterior tibial bypass graft in 5/92 and skin grafting in 7/92. R heel wound subsequently improved but pt developed L plantar ulceration requiring debridement 10/92. Cultures grew MSSA. Pt was subsequently treated w/ extended course of doxycycline, rifampin through 2/93. She subsequently did well until developing R heel ulcer while undergoing psychiatric hospitalization in mid 2/94. She was initially hospitalized at Altadena Hospital, where she underwent debridement of wound and treatment w/ extended course of penicillin VK and probenicid. Wound failed to improve. Pt was rehospitalized on 3/18 at GCCfor further management. She underwent incision and debridement on 3/18. Intraoperative evaluation revealed ulcer wound tracking to bone. Intraoperative gram stain revealed GPCs in pairs. Intraoperative cultures are pending. Pt was subsequently treated w/ vancomycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole. 




On interview, pt reports feeling generally well. No F/C/NS. Appetite normal. Had  previously noted creeping erythema up R leg, now resolved.

Heme:    

WBC:  
4.7              

HCT:

Plt:   290



Impression
52F w/ DM, PVD and hx of R heel ulceration s/p skin grafting in 5/92 and L midfoot MSSA infection in 9/92, now w/ relapse of R heel ulceration. Intraoperative cultures show involvement of bone. Clinical picture is concerning for osteomyelitis. Possible culprit organisms include drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which should be treated empirically while awaiting cultures. Pt will likely require an extended course of IV therapy for treatment of osteomyelitis.



Recommendations

 



Follow up intraoperative cultures

Continue vancomycin 1g IV Q24H; check trough prior to fourth dose.

Discontinue levofloxacin, metronidazole.
