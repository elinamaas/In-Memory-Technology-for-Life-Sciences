ROS
As detailed. He also has been c/o dizziness and weakness after dialysis, which was the main reason he refused to go for HD yesterday. No additional hx is available, no known sick contact per wife. When he was in ED, he was noted to have LGF 100.4, hypertensive and tachycardic. He is waiting for head CT and possible LP.
 
EXAM
T 100.4, P 110, BP 150/80, R 26, SO2 94%(4L)
NAD, limited cooperation with exam, A+O x2
CV: tachy/reg, no rubs
CHEST: CTA ant
ABD: soft, NT/ND/NABS
EXT: 1+ edema
Neuro: nonfocal-limited exam

DATAEKG is not available for review, but no acute ischemic changes and no widened QRS/peaked T wave per ED.
PCXR: poor penetration, but no acute process
Head CT       IMPRESSION:

1. No hemorrhage, mass lesion, or evidence of acute territorial
infarction.

2. Extensive nonspecific periventricular, deep, and subcortical
white matter changes are likely sequela from chronic
microangiopathic disease.

3. Old lacunar infarctions in the left caudate head and right
caudate-anterior corona radiata.
Evaluation for acute ischemia is limited in the areas of extensive
white matter disease. Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging
is more sensitive in assessing for acute ischemia and should be
obtained as clinically indicated.
