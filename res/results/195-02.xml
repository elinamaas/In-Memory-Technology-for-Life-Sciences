PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
                                              7-21-79
 
 
 
History of Present Illness:  Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to 
me.  I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery 
disease, hypertension, and diabetes.  The patient has had a positive 
exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt 
that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.  However, patient was 
overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by 
approximately 50 lb. at which time he would be suitable for cardiac 
catheterization on the Pontiac equipment.  Patient was seen last night 
in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain 
which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right 
flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.  
 
On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.  His exam was 
notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.  
His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as 
well.  His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, 
did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.  An 
abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the 
presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.  IVP 
was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.  He was given Toradol 
in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some 
Motrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.  I was called by 
the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right 
flank.  On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was 
brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.  On exam 
he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with 
pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his 
abdomen.  Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no 
peritoneal signs.
 
Assessment and Plan:  While I am concerned about his possible renal 
pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be 
musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I 
feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will 
undergo this study this afternoon.  I have also sent off a repeat CBC 
with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to 
rule out pancreatitis.  Of note, patient does have a history of peptic 
ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and 
reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.  He is also 
status post cholecystectomy.  I will review his IVP later today and make 
further therapeutic interventions at that time.
