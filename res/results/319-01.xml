CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 61 year old gentleman
here for his first visit to me as his PCP, referred by Dr.
Xavier.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/PAST MEDICAL HISTORY BY PROBLEMS:
 The patient has no acute complaints today.  His medical
history includes:
1.  Hypertension.  He is currently on hydrochlorothiazide 25
mg q.d. and aspirin q.d.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is on 30 mg q.h.s. of
simvastatin.  His last lipid panel in April of this year
showed total cholesterol of 196, triglycerides 169, HDL 52,
and LDL of 110.  He has no LFTs on file.
3.  Psychiatry.  According to the patient, he carried a
diagnosis of major depression with paranoid features.  He is
being followed by Dr. Uhler, psychiatrist at Marshfield Clinic as well as Betty Villasenor, a therapist at Marshfield Clinic.  He is currently on Depakote, Tegretol, Risperdal,
and Paxil although he does not know the doses of his
medications.  He still feels depressed but his paranoid
symptoms have subsided.  He has no manic or hypermanic
episodes.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Paxil, Risperdal,
Tegretol, Depakote doses unknown, simvastatin 30 mg q.h.s.,
HCTZ 20 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs.
 He quit drinking alcohol 16 years ago.  He has not been
sexually active for 16 years and is currently not
interested.  He lives by himself in  Denver Drive, walks
about 20 minutes per day, and is from Louisa originally.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother and father died of MIs in their 70s.
 There is no history of sudden cardiac death.  No cancer,
liver, kidney, or thyroid disease in the family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 132/84, heart rate 84,
and weight 202 pounds.  The remainder of the exam is
deferred.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Hypertension.  The patient is well controlled on his
current regimen.  I will therefore not change anything
today.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is at his goal LDL
level.  I will continue to follow his lipid panel yearly.  I
will also check LFTs today, given that he had a statin.
3.  Psychiatry.  The patient will follow up with his
psychiatrist and therapist.  He will let me know his actual
medication and medication doses at his earliest convenience.
 Also, I will recheck an LFT as stated above, given that he
is on possibly hepatotoxic psychoactive medications.
4.  Healthcare maintenance.  I have emphasized to the
patient the benefits of weight reduction as well as
increasing his exercise.  He is not interested in any
exercise as in walking and I have therefore counseled him to
walk longer and faster.  He had a negative flexible
sigmoidoscopy in November 2083 and I will give him stool
cards today.  His last tetanus was 10 years ago and he is
not interested in the booster today.  His immunizations are
otherwise up to date according to him and he will need the
remainder of the history and a full physical exam at the
next visit in 3 months' time.
