 Impression: 65 year old gentleman with multiple stroke risk factors, onset of dysarthria, aphasia, dizziness, ataxia at 13:00 today. Symptoms improving over first 30-60 minutes, but residual RUE drift, dysarthria, and (initally) upgoing R toe. Suspicious for L MCA cortical event. L ICA stenosis and/or embolic event +/- fetal left PCA possible concerns (?cortical vs v-b etiology of dizziness). Cannot obtain CTA secondary to elevated creatinine.  



Plan:  

1.	Admit to RDA 

2.	MRI/MRA. MR Perfusion study if L ICA stenosis or suggestion of intracranial stenosis. 

3.	As event occurred on ASA, provide heparin PTT 60-80, continue ASA at decreased dose (81 qD). Watch platelets, as pt starting with platelets =  150

4.	Hold antihypertensive, but continue isosorbide for known cardiac ischemic history. 

5.	Echo, Holter (for known bradycardia; eval for events with HR <<40. 

6.	PT/speech therapy. 

7.	Careful glycemic control (holding metformin).
